## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Diego Castro
Strategic Consultan
I am an enthusiast of learning. Acquiring new knowledge and sharing it 
not only enriches my intellectual capacity but also nurtures my spirit 
and provides me with immense satisfaction. 

âœ¨ I specialize in Strategic Management for SMEs, focusing on maximizing business unit performance, mitigating risks, and achieving robust financial results. With over 16 years of experience in the financial sector, I have developed skills in risk identification, management, and control, financial structuring, financial analysis and planning, as well as strategic direction. My knowledge in bank management is substantial.
